# Quimb-Tutorials
Tutorials using [Quimb](https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a quantum circuit simulator that uses tensor networks.

Although the documentation for Quimb is quite thorough and clear, it requires an understanding of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, machine learning, and some familiarity with Python. This repository is intended to fill these gaps for readers who do not have the background in quantum computing, phsyics, and Python programming. It will provide more tutorials with detailed calculations, modified and additional examples from the Quimb documentation, mathematical background material, links to YouTube video lectures, and visual illustrations. The notebooks in this repository will be linked to Binder making it easy to run and replicate results.
